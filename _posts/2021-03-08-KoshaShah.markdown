A good design to me is a design that depicts reality beyond language. Growing up in an immigrant family, visuals have been a huge way for me to learn and understand new concepts. I find a good design to be something that doesnâ€™t need a description and can be simply understood. Something as simple as walking signs. Universal designs build an environment that is widely accessible for many populations. These deigns communicate a lot of information in an easy way. These designs focus on simplicity which makes products more usable and friendly for everyone including people with disables.
