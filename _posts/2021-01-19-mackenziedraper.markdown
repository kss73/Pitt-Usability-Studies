#Exciting Design

Fluidity is attractive; the ability to swim and glide from image to image is essential for enjoyable viewing. In everything I make, the composition must be fluid in order for the rest of the piece to work. Designs that feature swirling, artistic colors and shapes draw me in like no other.

I love designs that catch your eye because they are cool. Things that are exciting, but not overwhelming. Something you’d want to wear on a shirt. Something that has spaces that contain depth and multiple worlds within the space it takes up.

I'm excited by design that goes against the norm. Anything that promotes diversity and divergent thinking. Designs that tease, “hey, keep looking. You might find something beyond the surface.” 

While simplicity can be effective, it should aim to be simple and sleek. Not simple and bland. It’s exciting to be exciting! I love designs that have fun with what they are and who they represent.
